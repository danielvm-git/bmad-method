## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

- Use **kebab-case** for all file names: `user-authentication-epic.md`
- Include dates in reports: `test-report-2025-11-09.md`
- Use descriptive names that indicate content without opening the file

### File Organization

- Keep related documents together
- Use subdirectories when a category grows beyond 10-15 files
- Archive old reports to `archive/` subdirectories after project completion

### Cross-Referencing

- Use relative links when referencing other documentation
- Keep links up to date when moving or renaming files
- Use `docs/index.md` as the central hub for navigation

### Maintenance

- Review and update documentation after each sprint
- Archive obsolete documents rather than deleting them
- Keep the most current version of planning documents in root folders

## Quick Decision Guide

**I need to...**

- **Plan a new feature** → Start in `docs/discovery/` (research), then `docs/epics/`
- **Break down work** → Use `docs/stories/` for user stories
- **Document architecture** → Use `docs/solution/` for design, `docs/solution/guides/` for implementation guides
- **Track progress** → Use `docs/reports/{type}/` based on what you're reporting
- **Plan sprints** → Use `docs/plan/` for sprint and release planning
- **Find documentation** → Start at `docs/index.md` for navigation
